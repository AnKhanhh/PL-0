### PL/0 Handwritten Compiler

#### Overview
I started this project as an attempt to learn about compiler design, with the goal of implementing a completely handwritten compiler for [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0).

#### Approach
Since this is my first venture into compiler development, I've chosen PL/0 for its simplicity, so that I can focus more on the basic concepts of compiler design.

#### Navigation
- **Documentation**: Miscellaneous notes are located in the `/doc/` directory. Given the frequent code refactoring, these notes will be reorganized upon project completion.
- **Source Code**: All source code is housed in the `/src/` directory.
- **Test Files**: Test files reside in the `/input/` directory, with human-readable debug files stored in `/output/`.
