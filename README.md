#### 1. Overview
This project is a handwritten compiler for the [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) language. The goal is to develop a complete compiler without relying on existing tools like flex, bison, or LLVM.

#### 2. Approach
As this is my first foray into compiler development, I chose PL/0 for its simplicity. While optimization is a complex topic, I won't be implementing a dedicated optimizer at this stage.

#### 3. Navigation
- **Documentation**: Miscellaneous notes are stored in the `/doc/` directory. Since I frequently refactor my code, I'll reorganize these notes upon project completion.
- **Source Code**: All source code resides in the `/src/` directory.
- **Test Files**: Test files are stored in the `/input/` directory, while human-readable generated debug files are placed in `/output/`.
