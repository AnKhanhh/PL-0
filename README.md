### PL/0 Handwritten Compiler

#### Overview
This project is a handwritten compiler for the [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) language. The aim is to create a complete compiler without relying on external tools such as flex, bison, or LLVM.

#### Approach
Since this is my first venture into compiler development, I've chosen the simple PL/0 language so that I can focus on the foundational concepts of compiler construction. For the same reason, I've decided to leave the topic of optimization for future attempts.

#### Navigation
- **Documentation**: Miscellaneous notes are located in the `/doc/` directory. Given the frequent code refactoring, these notes will be reorganized upon project completion.
- **Source Code**: All source code is housed in the `/src/` directory.
- **Test Files**: Test files reside in the `/input/` directory, with human-readable debug files stored in `/output/`.
