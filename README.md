**A PL/0 compiler implementation**
1. **About**
- This project is intended to be a completely handwritten compiler (i.e. no flex,bison,llvm etc). Since this is my first compiler, I choose PL/0 for its simplicity.
- For this project, I want to prioritize readability over performance

2. **Project Structure:**
- A lexer
- A Pratt (TDOP) parser for parsing arithmetic expression and a recursive descent parser for parsing program
- A semantic analyzer, to check for type and scope.
- My priority is to have a minimally functional compiler, so I don't intend to write a dedicated optimizer.
- Future Plan: an IR generator and a x86-64 ISA code generator.

3. **Project Structure:**:
- for source code, look inside /src/
- /doc/ containing miscellaneous documenting material
- /input/ stores test files
- /output/ stores human-readable files generated by compiler, for debugging purpose
