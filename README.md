Compiler for a simple PASCAL-like language
1. **Why this project exist?**
This project started as a small assignment of a compiler introductory course. For educational purpose, I have decided to implement a completely handwritten compiler i.e. no Flex, Bison, LLVM ... )

2. **Compiler Structure:**
- A lexer
- A Pratt (TDOP) parser for parsing arithmetic expression and a recursive descent parser for parsing program
- A semantic analyzer, to check for type and scope (WIP).
- No optimizer: my priority is to have a minimal, functional compiler so I will leave this very complex topic for future projects.
- Future Plan: an IR generator and a x86-64 ISA code generator.

3. **Project Structure:**:
- source code inside /src/
- files input/output are hard-coded in /src/main.c macros
- /doc/ containing documentations (unorganized)
- /input/ stores test files
- /output/ stores human-readable files generated by compiler
- compilers components are divided into subdirectories

4. **Documentation in progress...**
