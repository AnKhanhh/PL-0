**A PL/0 compiler implementation**
1. **About**
- This project is intended to be a completely handwritten compiler (i.e. no flex,bison or llvm ). Since this is my first compiler, I choose PL/0 for its simplicity.
- For this project, I want to make readability the first priority 

2. **Project Structure:**
- A lexer
- A Pratt (TDOP) parser for parsing arithmetic expression and a recursive descent parser for parsing program
- A semantic analyzer, to check for type and scope.
- My plan is to have a minimally functional compiler, so without a dedicated optimizer.

3. **Project Structure:**:
- for source code, look inside /src/
- /doc/ containing miscellaneous documenting material
- /input/ stores test files
- /output/ stores human-readable files generated by compiler, for debugging purpose
