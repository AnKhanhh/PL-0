### Semantic Analyzer

- **AST Parsing**: Parses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the parser and generates symbol tables to aid in
  semantic checks.
- **Symbol Tables**: The symbol tables generated during analysis are written to a `symbol_table` file, located in
  the `/output/` directory.
- **Semantic Checks**: `semantic_checks.h` implements declaration check, variable assignment check and variable evaluation / function call check.
